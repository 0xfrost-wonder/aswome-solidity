## Alternative Contract-Oriented Programming Languages

###  Higher-Level


**Vyper** - a more recently developed language, similar to Serpent and again with Python-like syntax. 
Intended to get closer to a pure-functional Python-like language than Serpent, but not to replace Serpent.

**Secure Ruby / Small, Smart, Secure, Safe, Solid & Sound (S6) Ruby (sruby / s6 ruby)** - the ruby programming language for contract / transaction scripts on the blockchain world cmputer - yes, it's just ruby; see the [**red paper »**](https://github.com/s6ruby/redpaper)


_Historic_

**Serpent** - a procedural (imperative) programming language with a syntax similar to Python. Can also be used to write functional (declarative) code, though it is not entirely free of side effects.

**Bamboo** - a language influenced by Erlang, with explicit state transitions and without iterative flows (loops). Intended to reduce side effects and increase auditability. 



###  Low-Level ("Assembly-Like")

**YUL** - official "intermediate" assembly language for the ethereum virtual machine (evm)

**Huff** - a low level assembly language for the ethereum virtual machine (evm)

_Historic_

**LLL** - a functional (declarative) programming language, with Lisp-like syntax. It was the first "itermediate" assembly language for 
ethereum contracts but is rarely used today.
